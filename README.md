## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows one piece of software or program to interact with each another. It defines the methods and data formats software components should use to communicate.

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

The interface is what comprises of the Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) are used to interact with software visually, this is more user friendly. The API side is more complex and is for software intities that define interaction through a set of rules.

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

**Web APIs:** Known as web services, it operates over the internet and initiate interaction between system and devices.

**Operating System APIs:** They provide a bridge between the operating system and applications

**Library and framework APIs:** They provide predefined functions to aid in application development.

**Database APIs:** This allows for data retrieval between the application and the database.

**Hardware APIs:** Same as database APIs but instead of the a database they get information from certain hardware.

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs?

These tools are user-friendly as they have a interface instead of instead of diving into into complex code. Good examples are Insomnia and Postman. It is important to have the correct tools as they make the experience easier and more efficient.

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

The side that is more comfortable is the Postman or Insomnia side as I haven't dived into the code side of APIs. So that would be area of improvement in the future of this course.
